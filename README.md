_congratulations! you found the repository for_
# vlusky.github.io
(i never put my github anywhere. so this either means you're really tech savy and are curious about the source code, and somehow able to figure out that if it's on github pages it is very likely that the repo is public... or you just somehow stumble upon this blindly. or you already knew my github. in which case, hi.)


feel free to take a look around my terrible code and try to decipher what they mean

special thanks to zimberzimber for helping me with this
